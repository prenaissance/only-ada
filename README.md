# FAF 2022 X-Mas Hackathon

## Theme - Make an application for a user persona.

User Persona - Ada is a 30 yo woman who is unemployed and wants to make a lot of money working from home. She doesn't like unproductive people, bad weather and whatever.

This application is trying to solve her needs by offering a platform where you can sell and buy access to online courses and other types of educational and entertainment content.

## How to run the application

Frontend - Have Node.js and pnpm installed
Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` in the frontend folder

## Backend - Have Docker installed

Follow the setup instructions in the backend README.md file
Run `docker-compose up --build` in the backend folder

## PS:

Bad coding practices were used in order to deliver an MVP in a short amount of time. The application is not complete and it's lacking in functionality compared to the backend.
